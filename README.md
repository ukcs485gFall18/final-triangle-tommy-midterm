Caroosal: A collaborative music playlist with real-time voting
Created By: Thomas Deeter, Zach Moore, Steven Gripshover

## Introduction ##
Our application, Caroosal, allows users to create a playlist for social gatherings that satisfies a majority of the event-goersâ€™ music tastes. To accomplish this, the playlist creator logins into Caroosal via Spotify and adds songs to a base playlist. Then, members at the party can upvote and downvote the songs to put their favorites near the top to be played next. Caroosal intends to make events as enjoyable musically to both the hosts and all the guests.
