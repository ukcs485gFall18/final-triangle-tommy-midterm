Caroosal: A collaborative music playlist with real-time voting
Created By: Thomas Deeter, Zach Moore, Steven Gripshover

## Introduction ##
Our application, Caroosal, allows users to create a playlist for social gatherings that satisfies a majority of the event-goers’ music tastes. If event guests are able to crowdsource the playlist at their event, then the overall satisfaction with the music will be higher. To accomplish this, the playlist creator logins into Caroosal via Spotify and adds songs to a base playlist. Then, members at the party can upvote and downvote the songs to put their favorites near the top to be played next. Caroosal intends to make events as enjoyable musically to both the hosts and all the guests. Caroosal’s identifying feature is collaborative voting. Other applications offer crowdsourced playlists, but no application encompasses private playlists alongside real-time updating playlists.
